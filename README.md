# ESGAN
Enhancement and Segmentation GAN (ESGAN)
We present a novel architecture based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to improve the lesion contrast for the pixel-wise segmentation. ESGAN effectively incorporates the classifier loss into the adversarial one during training to predict
the central labels of the sliding input patches.
